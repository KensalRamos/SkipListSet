# SkipListSet
This was a project in Computer Science 2 at UCF, taught by Professor Gerber. This project implements a skip list as a genericized SkipListSet&lt;T> collection in Java. The class implements SortedSet&lt;T>  (and hence Set&lt;T>, Collection&lt;T>, and Iterable&lt;T>)

The SkipListSet.java was ran using a SkipListSetHarness provided by Professor Gerber. I did not upload it as I, at the moment, have not gotten permission to do so.
